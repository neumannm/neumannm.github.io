I just found out, that there are actually public profiles on some websites I'm using for exercising, so I thought I could share them with you!

Check out my [exercism][exercism-profile] profile to see how I'm doing in solving interesting Java and Python exercises.

I recently also discovered [codewars][codewars-page], which I use every now and then to train my skills on narrow problems. You can check out my solutions on my [profile][codewars-profile], too!
