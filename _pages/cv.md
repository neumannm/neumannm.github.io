As part of my work, I have created a [syntax highlighting plugin](https://atom.io/packages/language-oxpath) for the [OXPath](http://www.oxpath.org/) language to [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. The code for this plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/irgroup/language-oxpath).

During the project, I have set up a database to collect curricula data on library and information science studies in German-speaking countries. To facilitate data entry, I created an accompanying web app with grails for CRUD operations, the code of which can be found [here](https://github.com/neumannm/curricula-webapp).
