## Work

### 2017-2020: Researcher at TH KÃ¶ln - University of Applied Sciences. Institute for Information Management, Team Information Retrieval.

I've been a researcher and developer in the DFG-funded project "Smart Harvesting II". Topic: Web Data Extraction.

As part of my work, I have created a [syntax highlighting plugin](https://atom.io/packages/language-oxpath) for the [OXPath](http://www.oxpath.org/) language to [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. The code for this plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/irgroup/language-oxpath).

During the project, I have set up a database to collect curricula data on library and information science studies in German-speaking countries. To facilitate data entry, I created an accompanying web app with grails for CRUD operations, the code of which can be found [here](https://github.com/neumannm/curricula-webapp).


### 2015-2017: Researcher at GESIS - Leibniz Institute of the Social Sciences, Department "Knowledge Technologies for the social sciences".

I was a researcher and developer in the Horizon2020 project "OpenMinTeD". Topics: Text Mining, Information Extraction.

As part of the project, I contributed to the Social Sciences Literature Text Mining Software Collection: [https://github.com/openminted/uc-tdm-socialsciences](https://github.com/openminted/uc-tdm-socialsciences).

I also contributed to [DKPro Core](https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-core) by adding a module to allow the training of a new NER model for Stanford NLP.


### 2013: Internship at PlagScan

In 2013, I did a two-months internship at [PlagScan](https://www.plagscan.com/en/), where I contributed to their plagiarism detection software. Specifically, I was responsible for implementing a routine that detects the references section in a scientific work, to exclude this section from further processing. I also helped in extending the test cases and contributed some new ideas to improve the match filter of the plagiarism detector.
